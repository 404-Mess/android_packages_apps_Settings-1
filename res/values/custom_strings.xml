    <string name="android_security_summary">Android security updates are a collection of patches to the Android platform and the vendor binaries that help it run. Since these binaries are closed source, we have to rely on the vendors to supply them to the OEMs and the OEMs to ship them to users so we can add them to our builds. As we cannot control this process at all, we want to make it clear that we only update the security patch level in the repos that come from the Android Open Source Project. Generally, the vendor security patch level will be whatever patch level the latest stock ROM is on.</string>

These are patches that Google push in addition to security updates for Pixel devices to address functionality issues such as connectivity, stability, and performance. Since we support more than just Pixel devices, they are included for all our devices.</string>
